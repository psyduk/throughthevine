# Through the Vine #

How do you search through all the awesome videos on the Vine app on your computer? Currently, you can't, and that's the problem we wanted to solve.

Use our app to search for keywords on Vine. Currently, you will get three videos at a time. To see more videos for the same keyword, refresh your page (coming soon you will be able to scroll to load more videos).

This app was made at AngelHack SF 2013 by Selby Walker, Alex Paley, and Andrew Ha. Thanks to Vine (and indirectly Twitter) for the awesome videos.

App Stack: Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
