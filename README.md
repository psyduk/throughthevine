# Through the Vine #

How do you search through all the awesome videos on the Vine app on your computer? Currently, you can't, and that's the problem we wanted to solve.

Use our app to search for keywords on Vine. Three videos are displayed at a time and you can click to refresh.

This app was made at AngelHack SF 2013 by Selby Walker, Alex Paley, and Andrew Ha. Thanks to Vine (and indirectly Twitter) for the awesome videos.

App Stack: Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
